Acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) is the most common cancer in children and can spread from
the bone to other body parts, including the central nervous system (CNS). While treatment
outcomes are generally good, leukaemia can recur in the CNS, specifically the brain. Standard
treatments directed to the brain are often toxic and can impair a child’s growth and development.
Additionally, early signs of CNS involvement are difficult to detect, highlighting the importance
of understanding how leukaemia cells survive in this unique environment. In this project,
computational analysis is done alongside experimental data to identify CNS-specific essential
genes. A genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening was used to evaluate thousands of genes
in leukaemia cells cultured under CNS-like and bone-marrow-like conditions. The screening
revealed a unique set of genes that appeared to be essential for growth within the CNS
microenvironment. To complement and cross-validate these findings, in-silico modelling was
performed using genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) designed to reflect similar metabolic
constraints of the CNS and bone marrow microenvironments. Gene knockouts were
computationally simulated using flux balance analysis to identify metabolic vulnerabilities specific
to the CNS.
